      Extras Plugin
    </h1>
  <p>The Extras plugin will initialize the optional addon plugins from 
<a href="../../../extras/">extras/</a> directory, if they were loaded.</p>
<p>Generally, for an extras plugin to have been loaded, 2 things must have happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>The extras plugins must be present in extras/ directory, for example after 
running <code>git submodule update</code></li>
<li>One or more extras plugins are added to the impress.js presentation (the HTML
file) by the author using a regular <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</li>
</ol>
<p>If one or more extras plugins were so added, this plugin will automatically
discover them and perform initialization (such as calling 
<code>mermaid.initialize()</code>).</p>
<p>If no extras plugins are added to a presentation, this plugin does nothing.</p>
<p>Note that some extra plugins (like mathjax) initialize themselves immediately, and
there&#39;s nothing to do here.</p>
